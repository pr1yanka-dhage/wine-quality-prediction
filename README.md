# üç∑ Wine Quality Prediction

This project focuses on applying **Machine Learning techniques** to predict the quality of wine based on its physicochemical properties. The dataset includes features such as acidity, sugar content, alcohol percentage, and other chemical characteristics that influence wine quality ratings.

## üìÇ Project Overview
- **Objective:** Build and evaluate models that can predict wine quality.  
- **Techniques Used:**  
  - Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
  - Feature Engineering  
  - Machine Learning Models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)  
  - Model Evaluation & Comparison

## üìä Dataset
The dataset contains physicochemical tests of red and white wines, along with a quality score (0‚Äì10).  
- Features: Fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol.  
- Target: Wine quality (integer score).
